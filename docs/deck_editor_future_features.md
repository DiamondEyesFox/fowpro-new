# Deck Editor - Future Features

These features would make the deck editor more similar to YGOPro's implementation but were deferred for later.

## Card Interaction
- **Middle-click to add**: Middle mouse button adds card from browser to deck
- **Right-click context menu**: Show options like "Add to Main", "Add to Side", "View Card", "Add 4 copies"

## Visual Feedback
- **Grayed out cards at limit**: Cards at max copies (4) appear grayed out in search results
- **Copy count in search results**: Show badge like "2/4" on search results indicating copies in deck
- **Deck statistics panel**: Visual breakdown showing:
  - Card type distribution (pie chart or bar)
  - Attribute distribution
  - Cost curve histogram
  - Average cost

## Utility Features
- **Undo/Redo**: Ctrl+Z to undo last action, Ctrl+Y to redo
- **Copy/Paste deck**: Copy deck list to clipboard, paste from clipboard to import
- **Recent decks list**: Show recently opened decks in load dialog for quick access
- **Keyboard navigation**:
  - Arrow keys to navigate search results
  - Enter to add selected card to deck
  - Delete to remove selected card from deck

## Quality of Life
- **Auto-scroll search**: Automatically scroll search results when typing to show best matches
- **Remember filter settings**: Persist last search query and filter selections between sessions

## YGOPro Deck Selection
In YGOPro, before starting a game there's a deck selector dropdown in the pre-game lobby. Consider adding:
- **Deck selection dialog**: Before starting a duel, show a dialog to pick from saved decks
- **Deck preview in selector**: Show deck thumbnail/ruler when hovering in selector
